            <li>“There’s only one thing I hate more than lying: skim milk. Which is water that’s lying about being milk.” </li>
            <li>“The less I know about other people’s affairs, the happier I am. I’m not interested in caring about people. I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name. Best friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes.” </li>
            <li>“Dear frozen yogurt, you are the celery of desserts. Be ice cream, or be nothing.” </li>
            <li>“Fishing relaxes me. It’s like yoga, except I still get to kill something.” </li>
            <li>“When I eat, it is the food that is scared.” </li>
            <li>“Just give me all the bacon and eggs you have. Wait … I worry what you heard was, ‘Give me a lot of bacon and eggs.’ What I said was, give me all the bacon and eggs you have. Do you understand?” </li>
            <li>“I’ve cried twice in my life. Once when I was 7 and hit by a school bus. And then again when I heard that Li’l Sebastian had passed.” </li>
            <li>“Don’t start chasing applause and acclaim. That way lies madness.” </li>
            <li>“I call this turf ‘n’ turf. It’s a 16-ounce T-bone and a 24-ounce porterhouse. Also, whiskey and a cigar. I am going to consume all of this at the same time because I am a free American.” </li>
            <li>“I’m a simple man. I like pretty, dark-haired women and breakfast food.”
            </li>
            <li> “When people get too chummy with me, I like to call them by the wrong name to let them know I don’t really care about them.”</li>
            <li>“If there were more food and fewer people, this would be a perfect party.” </li>
            <li>“That is a canvas sheet, the most versatile object known to man. It can be used to make tents, backpacks, shoes, stretchers, sails, tarpaulins, and I suppose, in the most dire of circumstances, it can be a surface on which to make art.” </li>
            <li>“Any dog under 50 pounds is a cat, and cats are useless.” </li>
            <li>“I regret nothing. The end.” </li>

        <h1>About Ron</h1>
        <p>
        Ron, who has an extremely deadpan and masculine personality,
         actively works to make city hall less effective and despises 
         interacting with the public. He loves meat, woodworking, hunting,
          whisky, and breakfast foods and sex. He hates and fears his 
          ex-wives, both named Tammy, one of whom is played by Offerman's real-life wife, Megan Mullally. Ron claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him but actually cares a great deal about his colleagues, and has a particularly strong respect for Leslie.</p>
