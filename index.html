        <h1>About Ron</h1>
        <p>
        Ron, who has an extremely deadpan and masculine personality,
         actively works to make city hall less effective and despises 
         interacting with the public. He loves meat, woodworking, hunting,
          whisky, and breakfast foods and sex. He hates and fears his 
          ex-wives, both named Tammy, one of whom is played by Offerman's real-life wife, Megan Mullally. Ron claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him but actually cares a great deal about his colleagues, and has a particularly strong respect for Leslie.</p>
